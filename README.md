Build a decision tree
1. implement a dataset.
2. read the csv file.
3.find the Ginni index (To find the best attribute which we can move down in best way  in decision tree)
   a:Attriebute selction measures(subtrees generated)
   b:Impurity measures
   Inequality measures (whole dataset)
4.binary splitting of dataset my amking subset.
5.Performed cross validation and n-folds of dataset
6.Calculate the Gini index for a split dataset
7.Select the best split point for a dataset
8.Create a terminal node value
9.Create child splits for a node or make terminal
10.Build a decision tree
11.Make a prediction with a decision tree
12.Classification and Regression Tree Algorithm
13.Test CART algorithm on diabetese dataset
14.evaluate algorithm
15.Find score of each attribute of dataset.
16.Finally the accuracy of each attributes.
